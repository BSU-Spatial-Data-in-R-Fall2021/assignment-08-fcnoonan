## Your assignment

The goals for this assignment are to:

- practice making maps with the various packages
- think about composition and the grammar of graphics
- critique various maps

_By the end of the assignment_ you should have several static maps displaying the datasets we've used in the last few weeks.

# Task 1: Show me your ugly maps!!
Find 2 examples of maps that you think are 'bad'. 
![A useless map that shows distance of each county from the coast, inexplicably using the unit of "county."](terrible_map.png)
![A map showing 2016 election results by land area, and without any labels.](weird_election_map.png)

_Question 1_ Why are they bad? What might improve them? 
On the most basic level, these maps are bad because they don't really mean anything. I struggle to think of any scenario, ever, in which you would need to know how many counties away from the coast a particular county is, when "county" is a totally meaningless and wide-ranging unit of distance. The second map is slightly more interesting, but it's equally unclear exactly why or when it would matter. I suppose it's one way of showing that, for many states, less populated areas might be more red? It's also pretty useless in that the lack of state labels make it hard to even know what you're looking at. I generally know where all the states are, but with this organization I'd be hard-pressed to differentiate between, say, Indiana and Iowa in any functional or accessible way. 

_Question 2_ Rely on the Healy and Wilke texts to provide some structure to your answers.
To expand on the above, it would appear that both of these maps got the science/data right (albeit for fairly uninteresting questions, in my opinion), but got the art really wrong. The color choice for the first map (counties) also doesn't have a color ramp that goes in one, consistent direction (goes from dark to light and back to dark again via different colors), meaning it would look bad as a black-and-white image and likely would not work well for a color-blind person. 


# Task 2: Load your libraries and build a dataframe
You can choose whichever datasets you'd like from the past several months as the subject for your mapping. You'll need to use at least one tabular join, one spatial join, and one extraction to create the dataframe. Load the packages, the data, and make sure everything is projected here. Give me a sense for what you are hoping to map.
```{r libraries, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(pander)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(units)
library(terra)
# install.packages("cartogram")
library(cartogram)
# install.packages("ggmap")
library(ggmap)
library(tmap)
# install.packages("patchwork")
library(patchwork)
library(viridis)
```

```{r load_data}
# regional land values
landval <- terra::rast('/opt/data/session16/Regval.tif')

# mammal richness
mammal.rich <- rast('/opt/data/session16/Mammals_total_richness.tif')
mammal.rich <- catalyze(mammal.rich) # get value layer
mammal.rich <- mammal.rich[[2]]

# PADUS designation lands
pas.desig <- st_read("/opt/data/session04/regionalPAs1.shp")

# PADUS proclamation lands
pas.proc <- st_read("/opt/data/session16/reg_pas.shp")

# get the column names sorted out
colnames(pas.proc)[c(1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 22, 25)] <- colnames(pas.desig) 
gap.sts <- c("1", "2", "3") # good with Gap statuses 1-3
pas <- pas.proc %>% 
  select(., colnames(pas.desig)) %>% 
  bind_rows(pas.desig, pas.proc) %>%  #select the columns that match and then combine
  filter(., State_Nm =="UT" & GAP_Sts %in% gap.sts ) %>% # filter for Utah and gap status
  st_make_valid() %>% 
  st_buffer(., 10000) # add a 10km buffer
# double check that it's all valid
all(st_is_valid(pas))
```

Build out the dataframe
```{r crs_crop}
# get regional boundary area
utah <- tigris::states(cb=TRUE) %>% 
  filter(STUSPS == "UT") 

# make vector data into SpatVectors
pa.vect <- as(pas, "SpatVector")
ut.vect <- as(utah, "SpatVector")
# get everything into the same projection as mammal richness data
pa.vect <- project(pa.vect, mammal.rich) # buffered protected areas
ut.vect <- project(ut.vect, mammal.rich)
land.val.proj <- project(landval, mammal.rich)

# crop raster to the size of the utah vector
mam.rich.crop <- crop(mammal.rich, ut.vect)
ut.val.crop <- crop(land.val.proj, ut.vect)
crs(mam.rich.crop) == crs(ut.val.crop) # true

# check it out
plot(mam.rich.crop)
plot(ut.vect, add=TRUE)
plot(pa.vect, add=TRUE)
```
```{r census}
# get census data involved
ut.census <- tidycensus:: get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = c(medianincome = "B19013_001",
                            pop = "B01003_001"),
              state = c("UT"), 
              year = 2019,
              key = "19c3ab9bcdc3ec1c81d11d51d790be308678a8d2",
              geometry = TRUE) %>% 
              st_transform(., crs(pa.vect)) %>% # get it in the right crs
              select(-moe) %>% # get rid of moe variable
              spread(variable, estimate)
```
```{r extract_join}
# extract and join everything
pa.summary <- st_join(st_as_sf(pa.vect), ut.census, join = st_overlaps) # find overlapping areas

pa.summary <- pa.summary %>% 
  group_by(Unit_Nm) %>% 
  summarize(., meaninc = mean(medianincome, na.rm=TRUE),
            meanpop = mean(pop, na.rm=TRUE))
# check row numbers
nrow(pa.summary) ==length(unique(pas$Unit_Nm))

# run zonal statistics
pa.zones <- terra::rasterize(pa.vect, mam.rich.crop, field = "Unit_Nm")
mammal.zones <- terra::zonal(mam.rich.crop, pa.zones, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
landval.zones <- terra::zonal(ut.val.crop, pa.zones, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)
#Note that there is one few zone than we have in our PA dataset. This is because we have an overlapping jurisdiction; we'll ignore that now but it's a common problem with using the PADUS

summary.df <- pa.summary %>% 
  left_join(., mammal.zones) %>% 
  left_join(., landval.zones)
head(summary.df)
```


# Task 3: Build a map with Tmap
Practice making a quick map with tmap. 
```{r tmap}
# kind of dumpy version
tm_shape(summary.df) + tm_polygons(col = "meanpop",  border.col = "white") + 
  tm_legend(outside = TRUE)

# more detailed map
tm_shape(mam.rich.crop) +
  tm_raster("Value", palette = viridis(n=50), n=50, legend.show=FALSE, legend.hist = TRUE, legend.hist.title = "Species Richness") +
tm_shape(utah) +
  tm_borders("white", lwd = .75) +
tm_shape(summary.df) +
  tm_polygons(col = "meanpop",  border.col = "white", title="Mean Population") + 
  tm_legend(outside = TRUE)
```

# Task 4: Build a choropleth with ggplot
Your map should have a basemap, should rely on more than one aesthetic (color, transparency, etc), and combine multiple layers.
```{r chloropleth}
# simple ggplot mapping polygons by mean income
ggplot(summary.df) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = meaninc))

# more complex ggplot with ggmap basemap
bg <- ggmap::get_map(as.vector(st_bbox(utah))) # get basemap for correct bounding box/location
ggmap(bg) +
   geom_sf(data = summary.df, mapping = aes(fill = meaninc), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data=utah, fill=NA,color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326))

# one more time with a scale
ggmap(bg) +
  geom_sf(data = summary.df, mapping = aes(fill = Value, 
                                           alpha = (Regval - max(Regval, na.rm=TRUE))/(max(Regval, na.rm=TRUE)-min(Regval, na.rm = TRUE))), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data=utah, fill=NA,color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option="magma")+
  labs(title="Species Richness and Land Value in Utah Protected Areas", x="Longitude", y="Latitude", fill="Species Richness", alpha="Land Cost Factor") +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326))
```


# Task 5: Build 2 cartograms
Follow the examples to build cartograms that display your region of interest based on variables other than area.
```{r population}
ut_pop <- cartogram_cont(ut.census, "pop", itermax = 5)
tm_shape(ut_pop) + tm_polygons("pop", style = "jenks", title="County Population (2019)") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.position = c("left", "bottom")) 

# get counties
ut.counties <- tigris::counties(state="UT",cb=TRUE)
# try a different population visualization with non-contiguous area
ut_pop_ncont <- cartogram_ncont(ut.census, "pop")
tm_shape(ut.counties) + tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(ut_pop_ncont) +
  tm_polygons("pop", style = "jenks", title="County Population (2019)") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.outside=TRUE) 
```

```{r income}
# cartogram based on county income
ut_inc <- cartogram_cont(ut.census, "medianincome", itermax = 5)
tm_shape(ut_inc) + tm_polygons("medianincome", style = "jenks", title="Median Household Income (2019)") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.position = c("left", "bottom")) 

# different style of cartogram
ut_inc_ncont <- cartogram_ncont(ut.census, "medianincome")
tm_shape(ut.counties) + tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(ut_inc_ncont) +
  tm_polygons("medianincome", style = "jenks", title="Median Household Income (2019)") +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.outside=TRUE) 
# looks like true trash
```

_Question 3:_ Reflect on the different maps you've made, what do the different visualizations tell you about the data you plotted?
Generally speaking, the maps tell me that species richness is higher in southern and western Utah and less-populated places, which are also areas with lower mean median income and lower land values. Species richness is lower around major urban areas with higher populations (namely, the SLC area), which also have higher mean median household income and land values. The maps that combine species richness and demographic data are more useful than the separately-visualized population and income data. That said, the cartograms make income and population more straightforward.


_Question 4:_ How might you improve the maps you've made?
For the map with the species richness raster under the population by buffered protected areas polygons, I might visualize the data in a way that doesn't obscure the species richness under the opacity of the population polygons. In that map, the species richness histogram also isn't completely intuitive, so I would want to adjust that for clarity. 

The chloropleth with median income is fine, but is somewhat disrupted by 1) the amount of missing data and 2) the direction of the color gradient. It's not intuitive (at least to me) for lower income to be a darker color, so I'd probably reverse the color ramp. 

The map that shows land values is interesting but difficult to interpret. The different transparency levels are hard to distinguish both on the map and in the legend, and the legend itself does not indicate the point of the transparency levels. Part of the issue with this is the overlap in the buffered protected areas, so maybe there are ways to work around that to improve the visualization.

The cartograms that use a different size/color of county polygon to represent larger or smaller populations/incomes are also aesthetically horrible. The ones that warp the shape of Utah work better, so I would just use those instead of the non-continuous version.


_Question 5:_ Is a map the best way to evaluate the data you worked with? Why or Why not?
I think a map is a great way to explore this data and start seeing patterns that might be interesting to explore further. However, the patterns created by overlaying data don't really say anything about trends, they don't point toward decision-making options, and they don't necessarily imply anything about what the patterns mean. What does it mean that protected areas near SLC have higher land values and higher incomes associated? Does that mean anything for conservation values on the ground in those protected areas? What are the species captured by species richness, and would these maps change substantially if we included abundance?

Although the cartograms are more straightforward and might be one of the better ways to visualize and/or evaluate the population and income data, they do not have the level of granularity that might lead to any kind of policy or management decision. For example, the income data do not say anything about income inequality or more granular patterns within counties.
